            <h2>History of Video Games</h2>
            <p>
                Though video games are found today in homes worldwide, they actually got their start in the research labs of scientists.
                In 1952, for instance, British professor A.S. Douglas created OXO, also known as noughts and crosses or a tic-tac-toe, as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Cambridge. 
                And in 1958, William Higinbotham created Tennis for Two on a large analog computer and connected oscilloscope screen for the annual visitor’s day at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York.
                In 1962, Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology invented Spacewar!
                , a computer-based space combat video game for the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1), 
                then a cutting-edge computer mostly found at universities. It was the first video game that could be played on multiple computer installations.

                In 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype multiplayer, multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. 
                It was known as “The Brown Box.”
                Baer, who’s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, 
                licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, 
                the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.
                Yet, one of the Odyssey’s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari’s Pong, the first arcade video game, which the company released in 1972. In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade counterpart.
                Magnavox, along with Sanders Associates, would eventually sue Atari for copyright infringement. Atari settled and became an Odyssey licensee; over the next 20 years, Magnavox went on to win more than $100 million in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its video game patents.
                In 1977, Atari released the Atari 2600 (also known as the Video Computer System), a home console that featured joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-colored games, effectively kicking off the second generation of the video game consoles.

            <h2>Impact of Video Games</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    Video games have found a role in <strong>education</strong>. Many educational institutions use gamified processes to teach and engage students.
                    While gaming thrives as a $120 billion industry built around entertainment, its application has charted new and exciting territory in recent years.
                    Militaries use them for training exercises, smartphones apply their principles to track fitness, and, in classrooms, they are wielded as a tool for teaching.
                    And they’re not entirely a new phenomenon in schools, either. 
                    “Many teachers have always used games,” says Yasmin Kafai, the Lori and Michael Milken President’s Distinguished Professor of teaching, learning, and leadership, who conceived the Video Games and the Virtual World course in the Graduate School of Education in 2008. “It’s nothing new.” 
                    She is also author of the book “Connected Gaming,” published by MIT Press in 2016 that provides the foundation for the course and introduces students to playing and making games for learning.

                <h3>Economy</h3>
                <p>
                    The gaming industry is a multi-billion-dollar sector, contributing significantly to the global economy. Major companies like <em>Nintendo</em>, <em>Sony</em>, and <em>Microsoft</em> have gaming as a significant part of their portfolio.
                    The gaming industry has a striking impact on the U.S. economy – providing stable jobs to nearly two million Americans and generating billions of dollars in tax revenue. This research represents the first comprehensive report on the gaming industry’s national economic impact since 2014.
                    The gaming industry directly employs 727,000 people in the U.S., with $33.3 billion of wages, salaries, tips, benefits and other labor income. This includes 559,000 jobs on-site at casinos and corporate offices, 17,000 at U.S.-based operations of gaming manufacturers, and 151,000 at businesses providing goods and services to casino patrons during casino trips.
                    Ancillary spending by casino patrons at other businesses totals $13.3 billion, including $2.4 billion of spending at restaurants and $1.7 billion at retail stores.
